## Demonstration

Deployed on a VPS server using nginx, gunicorn, and supervisor: link

## Description

Task manager is a web application that allows managing tasks. Users can create, edit and track tasks, assign performers, and change their statuses. Registration and authentication are required to work with the system.

Tasks are the main entity of the application and consist of a name and description. A performer can be assigned to each task to complete it. Additionally, each task has mandatory fields: author (set automatically when the task is created) and status.

The status indicates what is happening with the task, whether it is done or not. Tasks can be in the following statuses: "new", "in progress", "in testing", "completed", etc.

Each task can also have a set of labels that allow grouping tasks by different characteristics such as bugs, features, etc.
